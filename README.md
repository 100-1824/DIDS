**Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) in Python**

## Overview

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) using Python. The system consists of a central server (analysis node) and multiple clients (nodes) that send simulated network log data to the server for analysis. The server receives and processes these logs, providing a foundation for further intrusion detection logic.

## Features

- **Centralized Analysis:** The server acts as a central analysis node, receiving network logs from multiple clients for collaborative intrusion detection.

- **Client Simulation:** Clients simulate the generation of network log data and send it to the server at regular intervals.

- **Basic Intrusion Detection:** The server includes a placeholder for basic intrusion detection logic. This serves as a starting point for integrating more sophisticated detection mechanisms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `socket` library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/distributed-ids-python.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd distributed-ids-python
    ```

### Usage

1. Start the server:

    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```

2. Run one or more client instances:

    ```bash
    python client.py
    ```

3. Observe the server console for incoming logs and potential intrusion detection alerts.
